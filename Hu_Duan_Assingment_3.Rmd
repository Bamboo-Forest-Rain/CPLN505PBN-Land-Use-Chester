# Introduction

```{r Load Data}
# Read Chester land use Data and its geometry
Chester_L <- read.csv("Chester_Urban_Growth.csv") 
Chester_L_geo <-
  Chester_L%>%
  st_as_sf(coords=c("X","Y"),crs = "EPSG:25832")

head(Chester_L)
```

## 1. Summary Statistics 

```{r Chester Summary Statistics, echo=FALSE}
#Retrieve Numeric Data
Chester_Numeric <-
  Chester_L %>%
  select_if(~any(. > 1)) %>%
  select(-X, -Y)

#Summary Statistics in the Table
summary(Chester_Numeric) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", fixed_thead = T)
```

## 2. Binary Variables

```{r Binary}
#Find urban land use change between 1992 and 2001
Chester_L <-
  Chester_L %>%
  mutate(CHNG_URB = URBAN01 - URBAN92) 

#Select out the negative numbers, which indicates that the urban land use  in 1992 has changed to other use in 2021. 
Chester_L$CHNG_URB[Chester_L$CHNG_URB < 0] <- 0

```

## 3. Build Binomial Model 

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
